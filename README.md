>  A small set of terminal commands to use at secondary school

This is a (very) small project that features a few school use terminal 
commands. It makes life easier by being able to print out a periodic
table, trig-const cheatsheet, biology notes and more relatively quickly. 

### Current status
Currently, only output for trigonometric constants are in this project. 
More is coming soon!
